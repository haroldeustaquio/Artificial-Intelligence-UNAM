### Intelligent Agents

Implementations of different types of agents, each with a particular decision-making strategy:

**SimpleReactiveAgent**:

- `garbage collector`: Simulates an agent that collects waste.
- `smart light`: Controls the on/off of lights based on stimuli.
- `vacuum cleaner`: A vacuum cleaner agent that cleans specific spaces.
- `vending machine`: Distributes products based on stimuli.

**ModelBasedAgent**:

- `traffic management`: An agent that manages traffic flow.
- `vending machine`: Improved version that incorporates internal state for informed decisions.

### Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic system that assesses financial risk for car insurance customers:

- **Input variables**: Age (Young, Adult, Senior) and Driving Percentage (Low, Medium, High).
- **Fuzzy Rules**: Evaluate combinations of age and experience to determine risk.
- **Defuzzification**: Convert the fuzzy result into a precise value representing the level of risk.

### Adversarial Search Algorithms

Examples of search algorithms for decision making in adversarial and real-time games:

- **Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Adversarial search algorithms applied to zero-sum games such as chess.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: Algorithms for real-time decisions, suitable for fast-reaction games such as Space Invaders.
